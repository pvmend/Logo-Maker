# 10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

## Description

An app that runs in the terminal prompting the user with some questions what kind of logo they would like to be created. The user is given 3 choices for a logo shape and allowed 3 characters to type into the logo and is allowed to set the text and shape to any color they would like.


## Mock-Up

The following image shows a mock-up of the generated SVG given the following input entered by the user: `SVG` for the text, `white` for the text color, `circle` from the list of shapes, and `green` for the shape color. Note that this is just an image of the output SVG and not the SVG file itself:
